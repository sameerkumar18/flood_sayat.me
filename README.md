# Flood Sayat.me 🌊
Flood your Sayat.me friends with a annoying opinions 🍿

## What's this?
Back when I was in college(2017, somewhere in my 1st year), Sayat.me was a cool site where people created their profiles and asked their friends on Instagram etc to write an anonymous opinion about them.

One day, I curiously reviewed how they were allowing anonymous users to post opinions? Turns out it did not require any kind of login to post an opinion. Moreover, there's no rate limiting kinda stuff that can save a registered User's profile from getting spammed 🧨

I tried [reaching out](https://i.ibb.co/tsYbWFr/Screenshot-2020-06-30-at-12-55-29-PM.png) to Sayat.me's Founder, but did not receive a response

So me(Sameer) and Srijit decided to build visual POC about the vulnerability. You just enter a User's Sayat.me username, a text message, and the number of times you want it to be posted as an opinion on that User's Sayat.me page 🌋

PS: This doesn't work anymore. Sayat.me probably fixed it...

## Hosting
Previously we used floodsayat.me but the student license got expired :(
You can still checkout the site on https://floodsayat.herokuapp.com/

May this inspire the young hackers!
